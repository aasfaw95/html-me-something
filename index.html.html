                   <h2>Cosplay, what is it?</h2>
                   <p>
                       Before I get started telling my Cosplay journey, I thought it would be a good idea to explain exactly what it is for those who do not know.
                        Cosplay is defined as "the practice of dressing up as a character from a movie, book, or video game, especially one from the Japanese genres of manga and anime."
                        It has become increasingly popular in Western countries as more and more people are discovering this hobby and joining in! 
                        Many people dress as their favorite character, putting time and money into costumes that are sometimes better than the real version! 
                        In general, it's a fun past time that many people participate in as a form of entertainment or stress relief!

                   <h2>A Casual Hobby</h2>
                   <p> 
                       It was back in high school when I learned about anime and anime conventions from one of my closest friends. Back then, it still wasn't as popular as it is 
                       today, so there were limited resources and it was something that was seen as weird from outside of the community. After my first convention, I decided that I 
                       wanted to dress up as well because it looked fun- so I did! About once a year I would get a costume with a couple of my friends, go to conventions, dress up, 
                       and have time of my life! After high school, I had stopped going to that once a year convention and decided I shouldn't waste my time playing dress up as an adult.
                       Little did I know that half-way through my college years, I would meet two of my best friends who not only rekindled my love for the hobby, but also made it into 
                       something I could be proud of.

                   <h2>Sewing and Crafting My Cosplays!</h2>
                   <p>
                       Before I joined a cosplay group, I knew next to nothing how to sew. In order to get the quality of cosplays I wanted at a lower cost, I (like many others in the 
                       hobby) taught myself how to sew! I've also learned how to work with resin, foam, and build armor. I'm by no means an expert, but I do find that there is some pride and 
                       joy in wearing something I created myself! Of course, it's not always easy, and sometimes it's frustrating when something you put hours in doesn't turn out the way 
                       you pictured it, but most of the time it's worth it! Many of my cosplays are made with literal blood, sweat, and tears, but the amount of joy I feel when I put it on always
                       outweighs the negatives.
                   </p>

                    <h2>Traveling and Photoshoots</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once I had joined a cosplay group with my friends, my entire world of cosplay had changed. Previously, I had no other knowledge of other conventions and professional 
                        photoshoots, but pretty soon I found myself doing photoshoots with my group at least four times a year and traveling to conventions near and far (even flying on a plane for 
                        some)! Every convention was fun, and getting professional photos of my work quickly became my favorite part of the hobby. Below you'll find a few pictures that I'm most proud of.

                   <p>
                       Cosplay for me is not yet over! Right now I am planning on attending conventions in 2021 with my friends and learning even more about crafting and creating. I'm excited to see what the 
                       future, and can't wait to make even more memories doing what I love with my friends!
